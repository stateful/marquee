## Contributing Code

In order to propose changes to the code, please check out the repository and install neccessary dependencies:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:stateful/vscode-marquee.git
cd vscode-marquee
yarn install
```

Next, build the project:

```sh
yarn build:dev
```

and open up VSCode:

```sh
code .
```

Now, you can start to run the built version when pressing `F5`. Make sure to run `yarn watch` (or `SHIFT + CMD + B`) in one of your terminals so that the project is being rebuild everytime you change a file. To restart the extension you can press `CMD + R` or `Control + R` (like reloading a website in a browser).

In order to ensure that types are updated and bundle recompiled after making changes, ensure to run the watch task:

```sh
yarn watch
```

### Adding a new Core Widget

Marquee maintains its codebase as a monorepo containing various of modules within the `packages` directory:

- `/packages/dialog`: utility package for creating dialogs within the webview
- `/packages/extension`: code that runs on the extension host
- `/packages/gui`: core webview application
- `/packages/utils`: common utility modules
- `/packages/widget`: common widget components
- `/packages/wdiget-xxx`: core Marquee widget code

When creating a new widget, e.g. a foobar widget, add a new directory within that folder, e.g. `/packages/widget-foobar`, and follow the folder structure as other widget modules. The `package.json` should point to an entry file that exports basic widget information, e.g.:

widget-foobar sample folder structure
```
packages
...other packages
└───widget-foobar
    │   build
    │   extension
    │   │   package.json
    │   src
    │   │   constants.ts
    │   │   extension.ts
    │   │   index.tsx
    │   │   types.ts
    │   │   Widget.tsx
    │   package.json
    │   tsconfig.json
```

Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the widget-foobar root
```json
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "outDir": "./build",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*",
    "../../@types"
  ]
}
```

Create a `package.json` in the widget-foobar root
```json
{
  "name": "@vscode-marquee/widget-foobar",
  "description": "Marquee Foobar Widget",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "main": "./build/index.js",
  "types": "./build/index.d.ts",
  "dependencies": {
    "@vscode-marquee/utils": "^0.1.0",
    "@vscode-marquee/widget": "^0.1.0"
  }
}
```


`packages/widget-foobar/src/index.tsx:`

Setting marquee up with our `Widget.tsx` ui
```ts
import React from 'react'
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'
import { faCloudSun } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons/faCloudSun'

import FoobarWidget from './Widget'

export default {
  name: 'foobar',
  icon: <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCloudSun} />,
  label: 'Foo Bar',
  tags: [],
  description: '...',
  component: FoobarWidget,
}
```

Add the new package to the workspace list in [`/package.json`](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-marquee/blob/dcd2d832853c3b8be9d65b58e736c7d43cacdaf3/package.json#L48-L62) also adding a new [`watch:foobar`](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-marquee/blob/main/package.json#L3383-L3399) script and import it in [`/packages/gui/src/constants.ts`](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-marquee/blob/main/packages/gui/src/constants.ts#L22-L33) so it is loaded by the webview. A basic `widget component` looks as following:

`packages/widget-foobar/src/Widget.tsx:`
```ts
import React, { useContext } from 'react'
import { Grid, Typography } from '@mui/material'

import wrapper, { Dragger, HidePop, HeaderWrapper, NavIconDropdown } from '@vscode-marquee/widget'
import type { MarqueeWidgetProps } from '@vscode-marquee/widget'

const Foobar = ({ ToggleFullScreen, fullscreenMode, minimizeNavIcon }: MarqueeWidgetProps) => {
  // ...
  const NavButtons = () => (
    <Grid item>
      <Grid
        container
        justifyContent="right"
        direction={minimizeNavIcon ? 'column-reverse' : 'row'}
        spacing={1}
        alignItems="center"
        padding={minimizeNavIcon ? 0.5 : 0}
      >
        <CopyToClipboardButton />
        <Grid item>
          <HidePop name="markdown" />
        </Grid>
        <Grid item>
          <ToggleFullScreen />
        </Grid>
        {!fullscreenMode &&
          <Grid item>
            <Dragger />
          </Grid>
        }
      </Grid>
    </Grid>
  )

  return (
    <>
      <HeaderWrapper>
        <Grid item>
          <Typography variant="subtitle1">Foobar</Typography>
        </Grid>
        {minimizeNavIcon ?
          <PopupState variant='popper' popupId='widget-markdown'>
            {(popupState) => {
              return (
                <NavIconDropdown popupState={popupState}>
                  <NavButtons />
                </NavIconDropdown>
              )}}
          </PopupState>
          :
          <Grid item xs={8}>
            <NavButtons />
          </Grid>
        }
      </HeaderWrapper>
      <Grid item xs>
        <Grid
          container
          wrap="nowrap"
          direction="column"
          style={{ height: '100%' }}
        >
          <Grid item xs style={{ overflow: 'hidden' }}>
            Hello World
          </Grid>
        </Grid>
      </Grid>
    </>
  )
}

export default wrapper((props: any) => (
  <Foobar {...props} />
), 'foobar')
```

### Run Code within Extension Host

If you need to run certain code within the extension host, e.g. if you like fetch data for the widget, create an `extension` folder within the widget directory and point to a file that exports an `activate` method, e.g.:

Create a `package/widget-foobar/extension/package.json`
```json
{
  "name": "@vscode-marquee/widget-foobar-extension",
  "description": "extension logic for Foobar Widget",
  "main": "../build/extension.js",
  "module": "../build/extension.js",
  "types": "../build/extension.d.ts"
}
```

The `activate` method is called when Marquee as extension is activated. You can use it to iniate an `ExtensionManager` instance that simplifies state and configuration management for the widget, e.g.:

`package/widget-foobar/src/extension.ts`
```ts
import vscode from 'vscode'

import ExtensionManager from '@vscode-marquee/utils/extension'

import { DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION, DEFAULT_STATE } from './constants'
import type { Configuration, State } from './types'

const STATE_KEY = 'widgets.foobar'

export function activate (
  context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
  channel: vscode.OutputChannel
) {
  const stateManager = new ExtensionManager<State, Configuration>(
    context,
    channel,
    STATE_KEY,
    DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION,
    DEFAULT_STATE
  )

  return {
    marquee: {
      disposable: stateManager,
      defaultState: stateManager.state,
      defaultConfiguration: stateManager.configuration,
      setup: stateManager.setBroadcaster.bind(stateManager)
    }
  }
}
```

Lastly import the method within the [`packages/extension/src/stateManager.ts`](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-marquee/blob/main/packages/extension/src/stateManager.ts#L11-L20) so that the `activate` method will be called accordingly and the [`tangle`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tangle) instance attached to the webview.

### Security Bugs

See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/stateful/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Release New Version

Package releases are made using a GitHub workflow. All you need to do is go to the [`Manual NPM Publish`](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-marquee/actions/workflows/release.yml) workflow and trigger a new run. Choose the appropriate version upgrade based on the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and the release channel. To help choose the right release type, here are some general guidelines:

- __Breaking Changes__: never do these by yourself! A major release is always a collaborative effort between all TSC members. It requires consensus from all of them.
- __Minor Release__: minor releases are always required if a new, user focused feature was added to one of the packages. For example, if a command was added to WebdriverIO or if a service provides a new form of integration, a minor version bump would be appropriate. However if an internal package like `@wdio/local-runner` exposes a new interface that is solely used internally, we can consider that as a patch release.
- __Patch Release__: every time a bug is fixed, documentation (this includes TypeScript definitions) gets updated or existing functionality is improved, we should do a patch release.
